It is assumed that you are able to communicate with your peer.
The init sequence will require you to first send a key to your peer
and then input the key received from your peer.
Once the key exchange handshake is done, you both will have access
to a common shared secret key, which can be used later to
encrypt and decrypt mutually communicated messages.`,
